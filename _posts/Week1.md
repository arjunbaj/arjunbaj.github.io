## What did you do this past week?
This past week was mainly getting reacquainted with the structure of classes and school days after a long and relaxing winter break. Additionally, I spent this week honing in on which CS classes I wanted to take after a more active use of the add drop system. As of now, I'm signed up for programming langues, software engineering and intro to security: classes I hope will be fun and challenging.

## What's in your way?
As of right now not too much. The only issue I can forsee is falling into a procrastination and work pile-up loop as I'm still in my winter break mindset(evident by the date I'm writing this post). I'm hoping with some discipline I can get back into habits I was in the prior semester.

## What will you do next week?
This upcoming week I'll be getting ahead on homework and also prepping for an interivew I have coming up this weekend. With respect to Software engineering, I'll be looking to get all the tools working for a seamless start to the first project. I'm also trying to get my summer community college credit transferred over and squared away as I've been putting it off for some time now.

## What's my experience of the class?
So far my experience in the class has been pretty good and I've really enjoyed the way the class is structured. This is also my first 1 hour lecture class since freshman year and has been really good, especially for my ability to concentrate. Moreover, the lectures on python, a language I've been using for some time now, taught me a great deal on some of the subtelties of the language I had not known prior, something I did not expect coming into this class.

## Tip of the week
I'm really a fan of nice aesthetics for things you spend a great deal of time staring at. With that in mind, I'm a big fan of the brogrammer theme(https://github.com/kenwheeler/brogrammer-theme) for sublime text. Apart for the name, its a really cool theme that really elevates sublime to a much more refined and "flat" theme.
